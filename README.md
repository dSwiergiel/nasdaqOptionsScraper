This MEAN stack application was made as a final project for my senior software engineering class. It's purpose is to scrape options info from nasdaq.com, store them in a mongodb database, and expose clean filtered data from the scrapes via Express REST API endpoints. This project also includes a frontend that consumes the API endpoints and displays the data with various filtering and exporting controls.
